Build a sleek, modern e-commerce website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with C++ if needed for backend processing). The website should have five main pages and include ad space, a product management system for the owner, and special styling for discounted products.**
 
### **Pages and Features:**
 
 
1.  
**Homepage:**
 
 
  - A clean, attractive landing page.
 
  - A navigation bar linking to **Product Page, FAQs, Cart/Checkout Page, and Admin Panel (for adding products)**.
 
  - A **dedicated space for external ads** (e.g., banner on the side or top).
 

 
 
2.  
**Product Page (Instagram-like scrolling feed):**
 
 
  - Users scroll through products in a feed-style layout.
 
  - Each product has: 
 
    - A **Like button** (to favorite products).
 
    - An **Add to Cart button** (updates the cart in real-time).
 

 
 
  - **Discounted products should stand out** with a different design (e.g., a red tag showing the percentage off).
 
  - A **hovering cart button** (like Amazon) at the bottom corner, showing cart count and linking to checkout.
 

 
 
3.  
**FAQs Page:**
 
 
  - A structured page with common customer questions and answers.
 

 
 
4.  
**Checkout Page (Payment & Order Summary):**
 
 
  - Displays **selected products, quantity, and price**.
 
  - Shows **subtotal, delivery fee, and total amount at the bottom**.
 
  - Offers **three payment methods:** 
 
    - **Card Payment** (form with card number, expiry, CVV).
 
    - **PayPal Button** for online transactions.
 
    - **Cash on Delivery (COD)** option.
 

 
 
  - A **Place Order button** that processes the payment.
 

 
 
5.  
**Admin Panel (For Adding Products & Managing Sales):**
 
 
  - As the website owner, you should have a private page where you can: 
 
    - **Add new products** (with name, price, image, description).
 
    - **Mark a product as "On Sale"** and enter the discount percentage.
 
    - The sale price should be automatically calculated and displayed on the product page.
 
    - **Remove or edit products** when needed.
 

 
 

 
 

 
### **Additional Requirements:**
 
 
- **Sleek and modern UI** with smooth animations.
 
- **Responsive design** for mobile and desktop.
 
- **JavaScript for real-time interactions** (cart updates, total calculation, admin functions).
 
- **C++ (if needed) for backend processing**, such as order handling and data storage.
 
- **Code should be well-structured and commented** for future scalability.
